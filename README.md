# freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects - Project 4 - Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map

See the result here: https://laurentlabine.github.io/fcc-datavis-choropleth-map/

I built this project as part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum to learn and practice Data Visualization using D3.js library.

The data represents the percentage of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher from 2010 to 2014 and can be accessed here :

US Education Data:https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/for_user_education.json
US County Data:https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/counties.json

The project answers the technical requirements as stated in the challenge located here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map
